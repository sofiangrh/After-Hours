# Description:
The Metacity is an edit of Dust, and the GTK and edit of Wasp 0.3 (both very nice). I think that with my modifications they go together very nicely!

What do you think? Tell me! Keep in mind though that I do not consider this to be "done" just yet.

> EDIT: Sorry, one thing I forgot to mention - I am using the "Onyx" background for Nautilus, and I have the location bar and buttons tool-bar both turned on. It looks find with either combination of the 2, or none, or both, but just thought you should know.

> EDIT: One more thing :p Of course you can arrange the panels any way you want, but I only tested them like they are shown in the picture, so some odd arrangements might have problems - don't know. P.S., it's 26 px high (weird, I know, but it looked better I thought (a little more space between the edge and the stuff))
